## ðŸ“œ Swagger Documentation

Swagger is available at: [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)

### Steps to Use:
1. Open the Swagger URL in your browser.
2. Use the `POST /auth/login` endpoint to log in as an admin.
3. Copy the JWT token from the response.
4. Click the "Authorize" button in Swagger and paste the token (with `Bearer ` prefix).
5. Access the secure admin APIs.

## ðŸ“– API Endpoints

### Public APIs
- `GET /services` - View available services (paginated)
- `GET /services/:id` - View details of a specific service
- `POST /bookings` - Book a service
- `GET /bookings/:id` - Check booking status by ID

### Admin APIs (Require JWT Token)
- `POST /auth/login` - Admin login
- `GET /admin/bookings` - View all bookings
- `POST /admin/services` - Create a new service
- `PUT /admin/services/:id` - Update a service
- `DELETE /admin/services/:id` - Delete a service

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **JWT Token Not Working in Swagger**
  - Ensure the token is prefixed with `Bearer ` when authorizing in Swagger.
  - Check that the `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` matches the one used in the application.

- **Database Connection Issues**
  - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the credentials in `.env` are correct.
  - If using Docker, ensure the `DATABASE_URL` points to the correct host.

- **Email/SMS Notifications Not Working**
  - Verify the SMTP and Twilio credentials in `.env`.
  - Check the logs for any errors related to email or SMS services.
